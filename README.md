## Welcome to My Home Lab Repository 👨🏾‍💻

This repository will serve as a documentation for my journey as I get hands-on experience with offensive and defensive tasks. These tasks will be done in virtual machines (VMs) to create a controlled environment where I can practice and enhance my Cybersecurity skills. 

### Why a Home Lab? 🤔💭

Creating a home lab serves several key purposes:

- **Safe Exploration** 🔒: Provides a secure environment to experiment with different attack and defense strategies without risking my personal system.
- **Cost Efficiency** 💸: Utilizes existing hardware and free software to create a solid lab setup.
- **Scalability** 📈: Easily add, modify, or remove VMs to simulate different network configurations.
- **Practical Learning** 💡: Offers hands-on experience with tools and techniques used in both red and blue team operations.

### Components of the Home Lab

**Hardware**: CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 8-Core Processor (4.20GHz), RAM: 32GB (6000MHz)

**Virtualisation Software**: VirtualBox 7.0.20

**Security Tools**: A range of offensive (e.g. nmap) and defensive (e.g. Wireshark) tools to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios.

### Getting Started

⚔️ ATTACK: Kali Linux

🛡️ DEFEND: Ubuntu

🚀 As I progress, I look forward to introducing other elements such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, ect.

🎯 Through continuous practice and refinement in this homelab, I aim to build a strong foundation in both red teaming and blue teaming. This practical experience will be invaluable in developing the skills necessary for a career in cybersecurity or enhancing my current skill set. These practical experiences will be documented in their respective sections.
